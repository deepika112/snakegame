# snakegame

This is the source code for Snake game developed in C++ language and on Turbo CPP platform. There is a food('$') which is randomly generated by the system, as soon as the snake eats the food, it gets bigger.The main idea of the programme is based on creating a 2D character array named snake_array of larger size and then store different characters like '*', '$' etc at appropriate indexes.

These are the following rules for the game:
  
  **1:PRESS W-> to go up**
  
  **2:PRESS S-> to go down**
	
  **3:PRESS A-> to go left**
	
  **4:PRESS D-> to go right**
	
  **5:PRESS X-> to exit**
  
  **PRESS 0 TO START GAME**
  
  There are following functions used in program:
  
  _1: growth() it adds tail to the snake as soon as it eats the food and also manages the movement of the snake_
  
  _2: snake() it displays the snake at the bottom left corner and score at the bottom right corner_
  
  _3: eat() it tells whether the snake has eaten the food i.e. it returns 1 if the snake eats food and 0 if not_
  
  _4: score_cal() it calculates the score_
  
  _5: food() it generates food at random place within the boundary_
  
  _6: display() it displays the final elements of the snake_array_
  
  _7: wall() it creates wall, assigns food and the head of the snake i.e. it stores the character '*', '$', 'O' in the snake_array to create the wall, food and head of the snake respectively_
  
  _8: collision() it checks whether the snake has collided with itself or not_
  
  _9: move() it moves the snake in different directions according to the user input_
  
  _10: call() it calls all the above function in a particular sequence for the proper execution of the snake game_
